# 📊 Crime & Loan Analytics – Big Data and Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates data analysis, visualisation, and machine learning using real-world datasets. It was completed as part of my university coursework for the Big Data and Machine Learning module at De Montfort University. **Final mark: 80% (Distinction).**

## 🔍 Part A: Crime Data Analysis (2022)

- Dataset: Monthly crime reports from Derbyshire, Kent, and Leicestershire (UK)
- Tools: Apache Spark (PySpark), Spark SQL, Matplotlib
- Tasks:
  - Combined and cleaned 12-month datasets across counties
  - Standardised region names for accurate analysis
  - Ran SQL queries to extract monthly crime trends and common crime types
  - Visualised data using line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts

📈 **Key Insight:** Kent recorded the highest number of crimes in 2022. Violence and sexual offences were the most common.

## 🤖 Part B: Loan Approval Prediction (Classification Models)

- Dataset: Loan applications with applicant details and approval status
- Tools: PySpark MLlib, StringIndexer, OneHotEncoder, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
- Tasks:
  - Cleaned data and handled missing values
  - Encoded categorical features
  - Trained two ML models: Decision Tree & Logistic Regression
  - Evaluated both using accuracy, precision, recall & confusion matrices

📊 **Key Insight:** Logistic Regression slightly outperformed Decision Tree (75.3% vs 74.7% accuracy) and had stronger precision.
